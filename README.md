# web-microblog
A simple Microblog created using html, css, mongodb, and python flask. \
Unfortunately the microblog logo does not render due to the free deployement sevice that I used. \
Here is the link to the deployed [Microblog](https://flask-microblog-utz5.onrender.com/). It can take a while to load due to the deployment service that I used \
so don't worry if it seems to not be loading for a bit.
